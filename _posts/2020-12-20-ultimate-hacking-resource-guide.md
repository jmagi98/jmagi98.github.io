  A guide to some of my favorite books, vidoes, labs, and more.

---

During the second semester of my Junior year (Jan 2020), I took an 'Intro to Information 
Security' class. With little security knowledge, I had no idea what I was getting into.
But after my first successful buffer overflow, I was hooked. For the following 11 months,
I spent time reading, working on labs, and improving my security skills. Those skills helped me to land 
a position as a security engineer which I will start next May upon graduating. 

One of the things that I struggled with was where to get started. There are so many resources and 
everyone wants to sell you their online class. It's can be hard to pick out what is good and what is 
bad. As someone who has consumed both the good and the bad, I decided to create
my "Ultimate Hacking Resource Guide." This guide is intended to provide books, videos, labs, and more
for those looking to start on their journey. It covers a wide array of topics, from web security to 
binary exploitation to game hacking. This is not the beat-all-end-all guide, but a collection of my 
things I have interacted with and felt were useful.


*This guide will be updated regularly, as I am still learning and discovering new material.* 
LAST UPDATE: DEC 2020

## Books
Currently, I am reading "Grey Hat C#" and "Advanced Penetration Testing: Hacking the World's Most Secure Networks". Here is my running list of all-time favorites

### General Pentesting
- [The Hackers Playbook 3](https://www.amazon.com/Hacker-Playbook-Practical-Penetration-Testing-ebook/dp/B07CSPFYZ2) - Lays out security engagement in easy to implement 
steps. The author provides various "plays" which are each intended to be use in certain situations one may find themselves in.
- [Gray Hat Hacking](https://www.amazon.com/Gray-Hat-Hacking-Ethical-Handbook-ebook/dp/B07D3J9J4H/ref=sr_1_1?crid=21U0YDUSIGX3S&dchild=1&keywords=gray+hat+hacking&qid=1608520720&s=digital-text&sprefix=Gray+Hat+hac%2Cdigital-text%2C168&sr=1-1) - Covers a broad array of topics at a very base level. Good for learning a little about a lot.


### Reverse Engineering
- [A Crash Course in x86 Assembly for Reverse Engineers](https://sensepost.com/blogstatic/2014/01/SensePost_crash_course_in_x86_assembly-.pdf) - Short 25 page guide 
designed to be a no bullshit reference guide.
- [Practical Reverse Engineering: X86, X64, ARM, Windows Kernel, Reversing Tools, and Obfuscation](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Reverse-Engineering-Reversing-Obfuscation/dp/1118787315) - 
One of my personal favorites. Deep dives into assembly with examples and gives methodologies and tooling for reversing.
- [The Ghidra Book: The Definitive Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Reverse-Engineering-Reversing-Obfuscation/dp/1118787315) - Similar to the IDA pro book, but specific to Ghidra. Great for those
who want to get familiar with an industry level tool without paying the absurd IDA asking price.

### Web Security
- [The Web Application Hacker's Handbook (Portswigger Academy)](https://portswigger.net/web-security/web-application-hackers-handbook) - The 2nd edition, hardcover book is still relevant. However, the authors 
have created Portswigger Academy, which is updated regularly and keeps up with the latest attacks.`
- [Real-World Bug Hunting: A Field Guide to Web Hacking](https://www.amazon.com/Real-World-Bug-Hunting-Field-Hacking/dp/1593278616) - Entry level rundown of the OWASP top 10. Provides examples of actual bounties
which I found helpful.

### Programming
- [Black Hat Python: Python Programming for Hackers and Pentesters](https://nostarch.com/black-hat-python2E) - Great book showing how to use python maliciously. 2nd edition just released,
 now using python3.
- [The Art Of Assembly Language](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Assembly-Language-2nd/dp/1593272073) - Deep dive into various types of assembly. I use it more to look up things, but you could read it cover to cover if you please.
- [The C Programming Language](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628/ref=sr_1_3?crid=LR0V3OUOF3JJ&dchild=1&keywords=the+c+programming+language&qid=1608520983&s=books&sprefix=The+c+prog%2Cstripbooks%2C172&sr=1-3) - A classic. Read it. Then re-read it.

## Videos
### My Favorite Channels:
- [LiveOverflow](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClcE-kVhqyiHCcjYwcpfj9w) - The best of the best. Focuses on the *why* just as much as the *how*. His series on binary
exploitation is great for getting started on the topic.
- [stacksmashing](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3S8vxwRfqLBdIhgRlDRVzw) - Mainly does hardware and RE videos. Has a really cool running series on the Gameboy.
- [RPISEC](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY_laWYwPgB9eyxMdPjedcQ) - Livestreams from RPI's cybersecurity club. Lectures each dedicated to a certain topic and include a free lab.
- [Calle Svensson](https://www.youtube.com/user/ZetaTwo) - Has this super cool series where he brings in security researchers and has them race to complete a binary exploitation.
- [John Hammond](https://www.youtube.com/user/RootOfTheNull) - Great walkthroughs of online challenges.
- [Jack Rhysider](https://www.youtube.com/user/tunnelsup) - More well known for his podcast Darknet Diaries, but runs a YouTube channel that focuses on various infosec topics.
- [JackkTutorials](https://www.youtube.com/user/JackkTutorials) - Hasn't posted in a year, but makes informative pentesting videos.
- [GuidedHacking](https://www.youtube.com/user/L4DL4D2EUROPE) - Cool channel that digs into game hacking. Ranges from using cheat engine to bypassing anti-cheat. Something for everyone.
- All The Cons - DEFCON, BlackHat and most other security conferences post their talks online. Even if the topics are over your head, I still recommend watching them and trying to absorb as much as you can.
